Files :

* float64.glsl : The glsl file containing all the fp64 functions to compile.
* res_standalone.h : The output file produce by the standalone compiler. 
* fp32-to-fp64-conversion.shader_test : The piglit test file
* gdbLog : gdb output

Issue:

The standalone compiler don't have any support for dereferencing arrays in the
ir_builder_print_visitor.cpp, and the float64 code uses arrays.  As soon as it
hits the array dereference, bad things happen.
